# LMSrAudio [IMG] 64-bit for Pi 3 & Pi 4


I have created a build based on [LMS](https://forums.slimdevices.com/forum/user-forums/logitech-media-server), [Material Skin](https://github.com/CDrummond/lms-material), and [rAudio](https://github.com/rern/rAudio) (as I understand, it's a different branch of Rune Audio) for my personal needs and those of my friends.

I've added some features to make it user-friendly for regular users.

I want to share it with anyone who wants to use it. What's special about this build is that it can play YouTube videos on the TV screen and deliver high-quality audio through the DAC. Sometimes, even when I turn off the TV, the Pi 4 DAC continues playing music from YouTube. Importantly, you can use the YouTube app on a mobile device to search and control the Pi 4 playback. I've also included the Tidal Connect Docker (from the Github repository) for use with the Tidal app.

I did this out of a passion for sound and to enhance user-friendly interaction for audio enthusiasts.

SSH: user: root, pass: ros, and you can customize it according to your own needs.
